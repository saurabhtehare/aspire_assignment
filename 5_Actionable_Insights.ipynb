    "\n",
    "*Action*:\n",
    "- Conduct surveys to understand why engagement is low. This helps identify obstacles that users face and create targeted solutions.\n",
    "- Introduce gamification elements (leaderboards, badges, rewards) to motivate users. This makes tasks more interactive and fun.\n",
    "- Create tutorial videos or knowledge-sharing sessions to increase familiarity and confidence with the platform.\n",
    "- Offer more relevant tasks or content recommendations based on user interests or past activities. The more aligned the content is with the user’s interests, the more engaged they will be.\n",

    "- Conduct focus groups or individual interviews with users to deeply understand the barriers they face within the program.\n",
    "- Promote user-generated content where participants can share tips, stories, or strategies that helped them perform better.\n",
    "- Create a communication plan that keeps participants engaged through regular notifications, email reminders, or app alerts.\n"

    "- Implement transparency in decision-making processes by sharing company goals, results, and how each department contributes to them.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Action*:  \n",
